# LastRep
World of Warcraft addon to show rep progress when there's gains.

April 10, 2018 - Initial upload to Github of the files I've been using on my local PC.  Lots of work to do, but it's at least functional.  Once installed, it will echo a message with your current progress whenever you gain rep and will set your watch bar to that rep.  As of now, it has no working preferences to control the behavior, doesn't recognize friends/bodyguards/nonstandard factions, or anything else vaguely fancy.

To do:
- Preferences
- Build some kind of data structure to hold all factions and their attributes.  
- Show appropriate levels for non-standard factions
